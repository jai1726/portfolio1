In my college life, I actively engage in the Gulty Coding Community (GCC) and the Coding Club. In these groups, we organize contests, hackathons, doubt-solving sessions, and classes for juniors. As a senior, I assist my peers by addressing coding doubts and conducting hackathons. Additionally, I am part of South Folk, the dance committee of our college.

Turning to my project experience, I collaborated with a team of four to develop a website named MNNITIAN. This student interaction web app facilitates the sharing of experiences and interactions among students. It is a responsive full-stack project, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for the front end, and MongoDB, ExpressJs, and NodeJs for the backend. Another project I contributed to is E-Diary, an aesthetically pleasing web application used by a group of friends to manage daily tasks.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in C++ and well-versed in computer science fundamentals such as OOPs, DBMS, OS, and networking. Beyond my academic curriculum, I have explored web technologies.

            <br>
Outside academics, my hobbies include dance, cricket, and solving puzzles. I am open to embracing new technologies and approach tasks, whether individual or team-based, with a commitment to delivering my best. I consider myself a hardworking, sportive, and passionate individual.
